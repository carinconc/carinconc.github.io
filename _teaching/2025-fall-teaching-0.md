**LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

This course aims to reinforce the students' knowledge of structured programming and introduce them to the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. To develop their programming skills, students will learn:

- Structured Programming principles.
- Object-oriented programming principles.

**LEARNING OUTCOMES**

Based on satisfactory completion of the course, a student should be able to: 

- Demonstrate an understanding of Structured Programming principles (branches, loops, arrays, pointers, functions, file I/O, and structures).
- Demonstrate an understanding of Object-oriented programming principles (classes, inheritance and composition, polymorphism, exception handling, and templates).
- Demonstrate the ability to implement solutions using encapsulation and data-hiding principles from the object-oriented programming paradigm.
