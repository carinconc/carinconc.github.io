I am an Instructional Assistant Professor of the Computer Science Department at the University of Houston. I was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela. After working in the industry for two years, I joined the Department of Computer Science at Universidad del Zulia in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in 2001. After completing my Master's degree in Telematics, I started working on local area networks' performance analysis. In 2008, my research interests shifted to Information Theory, using compression theory to present solutions to different studied problems. In 2014, I joined the Ph. D. program at the University of Houston, working with Dr. Albert Cheng on Real-time systems scheduling using Information Theory principles.

Teaching Philosophy
======

My goal as a professor of Computer Science is to disseminate knowledge in the theory and application of computing, making sure that students learn how to solve real-life problems by using the theoretical background explained in class.

I believe that an important skill that every computer science student must develop is algorithmic thinking. From my experience, I have learned that first-year students tend to struggle more in computer science classes because they cannot find a clear definition of the steps needed to solve a particular problem. My strategy to approach this issue is to encourage students to fully understand the problem they are trying to solve before developing a solution.

I use a variety of learning methods to motivate my students. My lectures are normally bi-directional, allowing students to communicate their doubts and opinions about the topics that are being discussed. From my experience as a researcher, I have learned that in most cases, the right solution to a problem may be found only after multiple unsuccessful attempts to solve that problem. I encourage my students to participate in class by showing them that you learn both when you are right and when you are wrong because mistakes are learning opportunities.

To summarize, my teaching philosophy boils down to two key goals: to provide my students with the tools needed to become excellent computer scientists, and always challenge myself to become a better professor by constantly exploring and implementing new learning techniques to improve the learning experience of my students. 

Research Philosophy
======

My research interests are in the areas of real-time systems, and storage systems. My work is driven by a strong desire to bridge the Information Theory methods to measure the uncertainty of a system and real-time system scheduling, providing practical solutions for embedded systems. My main research area specifically focuses on Scheduling of Hard Real-time Systems based on Information Theory Principles.

My research philosophy places a strong emphasis on finding solutions that can be implemented to solve real-life problems. Real-time systems scheduling for multiprocessors is one of the areas in computer science where theoretical results are often put into practice, with many challenging problems that are normally NP-complete or undecidable. I offer my research as part of my students' learning experience, showing them my current work and its relationship with the theoretical background of the class.
